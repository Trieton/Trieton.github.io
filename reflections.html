    <h1> Reflection 1</h1>
<p>
    I know a couple of things starting out because I messed around with building a website a couple months ago. Most of what I already knew was how to create images, links and some style parameters like background colors. Most of my work for this site is going to be improving on the idea I was working on, which was a personal site for my friends to aggregate useful resources for our dungeons and dragon’s games.
The main problem I had was that it seems like the html viewer I was using in vscode doesn’t want to play nice with images. So, I switched over from the viewer plugin to the live server plugin. This is just so I don’t have to refresh every time I make a change.

<p>I thought creating a new page would be something you add to the index file instead of creating a new html file.

</p>
<p>If i want to use some symbols it would be good to remember the escape characters to help prevent conflicts, vscode doesn’t seem to like me using “>” in text.
As far as I can tell these are really the only ones I need
<br>   &amplt; represents the &lt sign.
<br>   &ampgt; represents the &gt sign.
<br>   &ampamp; represents the &amp sign.</p>
<p>I’d like to learn how to make animated repeating backgrounds like early 2000's websites.</p>
 
<h1>Reflection 2</h1>
    <p>
    overall style sheets don't seem too complicated, I'll just have to remember to update that file instead of styling individual elements.<br>
    I'm going to be sticking with VSCode for editing this site because of the utility that comes with its extensions and it is what I have the most experience with.<br>
    
    I didn't know you could call multiple HTML files to display on the screen at the same time I thought each HTML would be its own page.<br>
    I don't like how close the elements in the menu bar are, I'm not sure how to add a few extra pixels but accidentally using the external style sheet for "margin-bottom" somehow breaks the menu background, and the internal sheet doesn't add a margin. So I'm not sure what actually separates them.<br>
    With the introduction of more elements I need to think about forming a cohesive color palette, otherwise, the whole site is going to be greyscale.<br>
    I need to find out how to add more fonts to my site outside the included list.

    I wonder if you can have the columns shrink at different rates when you adjust the page.
    Being able to overlay text onto an image is a nice feature, having it attached to the image seems much easier than trying to line it up manually.
    I had some problems with the header on my personal interests’ page, it didn’t want to span the whole page. It turns out I didn’t set the width to 100% and it didn’t want to expand to fit the contents.
    I switched to using percentages for lining elements up instead of pixels and its driving me crazy, I thought the left column taking up 20% and the middle column being offset by 20% should line up but there is overlap.
    Setting up image maps are annoying, but I found an image map helper online pretty easily.

    <h1>Reflections 4</h1>
    <p>
        JavaScript is much easier to incorporate into webpages than I thought it would be. I thought I would have to create and link a separate file. The only trouble I had with this was trying to figure out why my sent message field wasn’t 
        populating but it turned out I had set the "Send Message" button to reset the input fields the same as "clear form". If I can get it working i would like to make an integrated dice roller into the site and start working on a character 
        sheet creator if JavaScript can export text fields into a file.
